                <p>Human trafficking is a global crisis that impacts millions worldwide. Together, we can help end this
                    crime.Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. Victims are exploited through force, fraud, or
                    coercion.
                    Millions around the world are suffering silently.
                    "It is an iron yoke, it is a strong band;
                    they are the very handcuffs, and chains, and shackles, and fetters of hell...
                    Which dark and blackening deeds are enough to make hell itself shudder,
                    and to stand aghast and pale,
                    and the hands of
                    the very devil to tremble and palsy...
                    And also it is an imperative duty that we owe to all the rising generation,
                    and to all the pure in
                    heart... Therefore,
                    that we should waste and wear out our lives
                    in bringing to light all the hidden things of darkness,
                    wherein we know
                    them; and they are truly manifest from heaven—
                    These should then be attended to with great earnestness."
